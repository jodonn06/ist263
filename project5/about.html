    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Who We Are</h3>
    <p>We are three college students who began In The Works during our first year of high school and have been working
        together for six years. Our diverse interests and experiences have allowed us to foster a creative work
        environment.</p>

    <h3>What We Do</h3>
    <p>We are located in the greater Philadelphia area and have reasonable rates for clients. By prioritizing the needs
        of our clients, we are able to produce professional-level videos for a wide array of filming needs. We have
        dedicated to serving our community. We produced a video for a local non-profit organization that was submitted
        to the Library of Congress. We have worked with our local school district to record performances for mass
        distribution. We value building and maintaining relationships with our clients to ensure that we produce the
        best possible product to suit their needs. We are interested in learning about new opportunities to improve our
        filming capabilities.</p>

    <p>"In The Works is incredibly talented and fun to work with! They've been very helpful in their work with our cable
        television show and our nonprofit's YouTube channel. They have the skillset for both a broadcast television
        quality live stream as well as the editing ability to piece together a recorded video for television. With all
        their experience in church settings, they fully understand the necessary dynamics when live streaming and
        recording at church for weddings and other events. They are incredibly skilled in studio settings and recording
        audio in challenging settings. You will be blown away by the quality of their work when assisting at your
